# SAP-ARIBA-S-4HANA
This repository serves as a practical demonstration of end-to-end (E2E) integration testing and data validation competency for a high-risk Source-to-Pay (S2P) implementation, specifically mirroring the 1GX SAP Ariba and S/4HANA environment.The artifacts within this repository prove the ability to define, model, and troubleshoot critical data flows across complex, financial ERP systems, utilizing core QA skills such as SQL Data Validation, API Unit Testing (Python), and Structured Functional Test Design (Gherkin).Core Integration Points (P1, P2, P3)The testing focus is organized around the three most critical data synchronization points in the S2P lifecycle:PointDescriptionRiskArtifactP1Master Data Sync (S/4HANA → Ariba)Incorrect purchasing data (e.g., wrong vendor bank details or inactive cost centers) leading to downstream financial failure.S2P_SQL_Validation_Scripts.sqlP2PO Transmission (Ariba → S/4HANA)Failure of real-time budget checking, leading to PO creation that violates financial policies (budget overrun).p2_po_transmission_test.pyP3Invoice Receipt (Ariba → S/4HANA)Failure of the 3-Way Match control, resulting in overpayment or underpayment, violating financial compliance rules.S2P_Functional_Test_Cases.xlsxArtifact Deep Dive1. P1: Master Data Integrity (SQL Validation)File: S2P_SQL_Validation_Scripts.sqlObjective: To audit the integrity of the most critical master data entities—Vendors and Cost Centers—immediately after the P1 sync from S/4HANA to Ariba.Key Focus: The queries are designed to preemptively find data defects that would lead to immediate failure in later P2 (PO) and P3 (Invoice) transactions. For example, Query 3 ensures inactive Cost Centers are suppressed from user selection in Ariba.2. P2: API Integration & Budget Control (Python Unit Test Model)File: p2_po_transmission_test.pyObjective: To model the expected behavior of the synchronous API used for PO financial commitment from Ariba to S/4HANA.Key Focus (Scenario P2-04): The model explicitly tests the Negative Budget Overrun case. It asserts that S/4HANA's middleware endpoint must return a HTTP 409 Conflict and a specific business error code (409-BUDGET-FAIL) when the commitment exceeds the available budget. This proves understanding of real-time financial control enforcement.3. P3: Functional Compliance (Gherkin Test Plan)File: S2P_Functional_Test_Cases.xlsxObjective: Provides 15 End-to-End (E2E) test cases for the entire S2P flow, documented using the Gherkin Given/When/Then syntax.Key Focus (Scenario P3-07): The test case for Quantity Mismatch failure explicitly requires the system to apply a Payment Block (Code 'Q') in S/4HANA. This demonstrates an understanding of the required financial outcome of a failed 3-Way Match.Conclusion: Value PropositionThis repository demonstrates the required shift from simple functional testing to integration quality assurance. My background in API, SQL, and detailed test design is directly transferable to managing the data and integration risks inherent in large-scale ERP transformation projects like 1GX.
