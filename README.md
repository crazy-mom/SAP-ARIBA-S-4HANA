# SAP-ARIBA-S-4HANA
This repository serves as a practical demonstration of end-to-end (E2E) integration testing and data validation competency for a high-risk Source-to-Pay (S2P) implementation, specifically mirroring the 1GX SAP Ariba and S/4HANA environment.The artifacts within this repository prove the ability to define, model, and troubleshoot critical data flows across complex, financial ERP systems, utilizing core QA skills such as SQL Data Validation, API Unit Testing (Python), and Structured Functional Test Design (Gherkin).
This repository demonstrates the required shift from simple functional testing to integration quality assurance. My background in API, SQL, and detailed test design is directly transferable to managing the data and integration risks inherent in large-scale ERP transformation projects like 1GX.
1GX S2P Testing Analyst Portfolio: SAP Ariba & S/4HANA Integration Validation🌟 Verifiable Testing Competency for Financial ERP SystemsThis repository demonstrates practical, project-ready competency for a complex SAP Ariba and S/4HANA integration project (modeled as the 1GX Source-to-Pay transformation).CategoryStatus/Skills DemonstratedDomainSource-to-Pay (S2P) SAP Ariba S/4HANA Financial ComplianceTesting FocusIntegration QA Data Validation (SQL) API Testing (Python) Test Design (Gherkin)Risk MitigationP2 Budget Overrun P3 3-Way Match BlockCore Integration Points (P1, P2, P3)The testing approach is organized around the three most critical, high-risk data synchronization points in the S2P lifecycle. A failure at any of these points causes financial non-compliance or loss.PointDescriptionPrimary RiskArtifact (Evidence)P1Master Data Sync (S/4HANA → Ariba)Data Integrity: Incorrect vendor/cost center data leading to downstream transaction failure.S2P_SQL_Validation_Scripts.sqlP2PO Transmission (Ariba → S/4HANA)Budgetary Control: Failure of real-time budget checking, allowing POs that exceed allocated funds.p2_po_transmission_test.pyP3Invoice Receipt (Ariba → S/4HANA)Financial Compliance: Failure of the 3-Way Match, resulting in overpayment or underpayment.S2P_Functional_Test_Cases.xlsxArtifact Deep Dive: Demonstrating Analytical Skill1. P1: Master Data Integrity (SQL Validation)File: S2P_SQL_Validation_Scripts.sqlObjective: To audit the integrity of core master data (Vendors and Cost Centers) immediately after the P1 sync.Key Focus: The SQL queries are designed to preemptively find data defects (e.g., active S/4HANA vendors not synced to Ariba, or inactive cost centers available in Ariba) that would cause immediate, catastrophic failure at the P2/P3 stage.2. P2: API Integration & Budget Control (Python Unit Test Model)File: p2_po_transmission_test.pyObjective: To model the expected synchronous API interaction used for PO financial commitment.Key Focus (Scenario P2-04): The Python unit test explicitly models the Negative Budget Overrun case. It asserts that S/4HANA's middleware endpoint must return a HTTP 409 Conflict and the specific business error code (409-BUDGET-FAIL). This proves understanding of real-time financial enforcement at the API layer.3. P3: Functional Compliance (Gherkin Test Plan)File: S2P_Functional_Test_Cases.xlsxObjective: Provides 15 End-to-End (E2E) test cases, documented using the Gherkin Given/When/Then syntax.Key Focus (Scenario P3-07): The test case for Quantity Mismatch failure explicitly requires the system to apply a Payment Block (Code 'Q') in S/4HANA. This is the direct evidence of understanding the required financial outcome of a failed 3-Way Match.Conclusion: Value PropositionThis repository demonstrates the required shift from simple functional testing to integration quality assurance. My background in API testing, SQL, and detailed test design is directly transferable to managing the data and integration risks inherent in large-scale ERP transformation projects like 1GX.
