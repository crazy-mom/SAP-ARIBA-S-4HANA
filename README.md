# SAP-ARIBA-S-4HANA
1. This repository serves as a practical **demonstration** of end-to-end (E2E) integration testing and data validation competency for a high-risk Source-to-Pay (S2P) implementation, specifically mirroring the 1GX SAP Ariba and S/4HANA environment.The artifacts within this repository prove the ability to define, model, and troubleshoot critical data flows across complex, financial ERP systems, utilizing core QA skills such as SQL Data Validation, API Unit Testing (Python), and Structured Functional Test Design (Gherkin).

2. It demonstrates the required shift from simple functional testing to integration quality assurance. My background in API, SQL, and detailed test design is directly transferable to managing the data and integration risks inherent in large-scale ERP transformation projects like 1GX.
